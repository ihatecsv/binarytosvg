# binarytosvg
A webpage that converts binary files into SVG images. Being used to laser-cut files onto wood, for fun!

You can access it [here](https://drakeluce.com/projects/binarytosvg), be careful!

## Disclaimer
Don't load massive files, it *will* crash your browser! This is basically just a mess of code that works. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
